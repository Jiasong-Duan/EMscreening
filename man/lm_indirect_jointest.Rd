\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Function to test indirect effects of exposure and potential mediator on the continuous outcome}
\description{
The effect of exposure on the potential mediator, and the joint effect of the exposure and mediator on the outcome are tested by linear regression models.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
lm_indirect_jointest(data)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
The tested data matrix with dimension of n by 3. The rows represent n subjects. The column 1, 2, 3 represent the data for the exposure variable, outome variable, and potential mediator, respectively.
