\title{
Function to test indirect effects of exposure and potential mediator on the binary outcome
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The effect of exposure on the potential mediator is tested by linear regression model. And the joint effect of the exposure and mediator on the outcome is tested by logistic regression model.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
glm_indirect_jointest(data)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
The tested data matrix with dimension of n by 3. The rows represent n subjects. The column 1, 2, 3 represent the data for the exposure variable, outome variable, and potential mediator, respectively.
